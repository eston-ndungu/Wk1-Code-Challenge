# Wk1-Code-Challenge

## Prerequisities

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 

NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution.

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.


## Getting Started

**Fork and clone** this lesson into your local environment. Navigate into its
directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual 
Studio

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
For this challenge, we are going to write a function that prompt the user to input student marks.
The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  50 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

We are first going to define a function by using the key `function` and and giving it a name `grade`. The function takes in a parameter of `grade`.
Use javascript constional statements to come up with solutions
For example: 
  ` if (marks >= 80 && marks <= 100) {
        console.log("A") 
  } ` 
 
 This will print the grade `A` for student marks that are between 80 and 100.
 Continue with the statement until you have come up will all solutions.
 NB// `The input should be between 0 and 100`


 ## Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
 
 Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. 
 If the speed is less than 70, it should print `Ok `Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.



## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
